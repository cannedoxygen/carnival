Simpsons Carnival is a web3-based interactive jackpot game themed around the world of The Simpsons.

🎯 Concept:
Players purchase digital "Keys" (Bronze, Silver, or Gold tiers: $5, $10, $25) to play a game where three animated, Springfield-themed doors appear. Behind each door lies a randomized outcome:
- ✅ Win: Double your money
- ♻️ Break-even: Get your key value back
- ❌ Lose: Forfeit your key cost

A portion of each win contributes to a live, growing jackpot pool. Jackpot payout is triggered by a separate condition (e.g., every 1,000 keys, timer-based, or Golden Donut NFT holder).

💡 Highlights:
- Fully interactive carnival-style frontend with character animations, sound effects, and Springfield visuals
- Smart contract-powered randomness (e.g. Chainlink VRF)
- Live jackpot tracker, player history, and referral system
- Designed for memetic growth and replayability

📁 File Structure Overview:

- `scripts/`: Deployment scripts, emergency utilities
- `tests/`: Smart contract, integration, and end-to-end testing
- `docs/`: Documentation on game rules, jackpot logic, and contract specs

This structure is designed for rapid development and extensibility across frontend, backend, and blockchain layers.
